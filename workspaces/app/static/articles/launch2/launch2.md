## SE Praisal V2 launched!

Today the version 2 of [Space Engineers Praisal](https://spaceengineerspraisal.net) is launched!

This day is also 3rd anniversary since my [first commit](https://github.com/Akuukis/spaceengineers-praisal/commit/c14ba7ba6e26a8a59af40b5cf5cc41a903d76a52).

Back at Dec 26, 2017, the [version 1](https://akuukis.github.io/spaceengineers-praisal) was finished. Since then the difference is significant: pretty as never before, analysis are much more informative, and you can even search for blueprint with many filters because there's a database now with the whole steam workshop pre-analysed.

That's all - now go **use it**, **share it**, and let me know how you like it (or not). See you on Discord ;)
