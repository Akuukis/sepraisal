## New server found!



SE Praisal has found a new server, provided by a fellow space engineer who believes that "this project should develop and exist as long as it is interesting." Thank you!

It took five months of waiting since [leaving the previous host](./looking-for-new-host), and another month of setup.

**SE Praisal is up-to-date again, faster than ever, and the [fleet rankings](./fleets) has been updated too.**
