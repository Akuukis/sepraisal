> SEPraisal is looking for maintainers.

> Hi all, my nickname is Akuukis. I made Space Engineers Praisal. I don't play the game nor use SEPraisal for years now, so have no interest in maintaining it anymore. But I feel responsibility to not just abandon it either, because website still has ~10 visits per day despite being half-working, and once a month someone DMs me willing to help SEPraisal.
>
> It's yours now. I'm handing over SEPraisal to SE community. Let's keep it simple:
> - make a useful PR on Github and I will grant you maintainer role in discord + Github merge rights
> - host a server with database and I will grant you maintainer role in discord
> - I will hang around the discord server as much I can to help you get started.
>
> Join Discord server to become or just hang out with SEPraisal maintainers: https://discord.gg/Ry93fePdHJ

I started this project as a hobby to pursue my curiousity about new and fancy IT technologies.
Therefore I see this project as a sandbox for various experiments and to try newest versions.
Some things may not be the best suited for its job, but they should be "good enough" and it was fun to try them out.
You're welcome to join.
