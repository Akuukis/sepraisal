I started this project as a hobby to pursue my curiousity about new and fancy IT technologies.
Therefore I see this project as a sandbox for various experiments and to try newest versions.
Some things may not be the best suited for its job, but they should be "good enough" and it was fun to try them out.
You're welcome to join.
